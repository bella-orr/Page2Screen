## Introduction
Page2Screen is a web application that enables users to consolidate all their book and movie reviews in one location. Instead 
By browsing different websites to find personal reviews and ratings, users can conveniently write, store, and share their 
opinions on what they read and watch. Within the simple UI, users can add titles, types of media, authors/directors, ratings, 
and comments on their most loved or most disliked works.Page2Screen allows story lovers to create a personalized hub for thoughts and connections.
